In this Presentation, a new Active Power Filter (APF) control scheme has proposed to improve the performance of the APF. This presentation presents a new technique with instantaneous power theory (P-Q theory) in order to control of APF under non- ideal mains voltage conditions. Performance of the proposed scheme has been found feasible and excellent to that of the instantaneous reactive power algorithms under various non-ideal mains test scenarios. MATLAB/SIMULINK power system toolbox is used to simulate the proposed system. The proposed methodâ€™s performance is compared with conventional instantaneous power (P-Q) theory. The simulation results are presented and discussed showing the effectiveness of the control algorithm.
